<h2>Effect of network structure and early innovator fraction in Information diffusion </h2>
In this project I applied Linear Threshold Model and studied the effect of network structure in size of early innovator, total time to achieve global information
diffusion and size of information diffusion.  I analyzed information diffusion. characteristic considering different network models such as random network,
Watt-Stogatz Network, Barabasi network, and Newman-Girvan cluster network.  Effects of other topological parameter such as network size and average degree have been
studied as well. 


<h2>Analyzing Temporal Changes on Twitter Communities</h2>
Collective attention, popularity, and influence dynamics have been widely studied in the social networks. Users' collective behaviors influence how an opinion or idea
becomes popular and spread across the network of users. The dynamics of a social network holds valuable information not immediately seen in the static structure of the
network. We believe analyzing the the temporal changes can reveal useful information about the network dynamics.  
Temporal analysis of such networks is a key to better understand these dynamical behaviors. These temporal changes show the fluctuation in users behaviors. It reveals
how a certain idea (in our case hashtags) becomes popular,
how it spreads across the network, how users change their opinion
and move from one group to another. We study temporal changes in patterns of users' collective behaviors on Twitter microblogging and social network. For two popular
political hashtags (\#tcot, and \#p2), we analyze change in topological and statistical characteristics of their retweet network. We also analyze how the participation
of users in the discussion about these hashtags and their interaction with others changes over the time. We show that the network structure changes over time and
temporal changes exist in statistical network characteristics.

<h2>Measuring Agenda Change in Political Discourse</h2>
Applications of automated textual analysis to the research on issue framing often assume the stability of
issue frames. However, both theories and empirical studies suggest the instability of issue frames, where
political actors shift from one frame to another in response to temporal events such as interest group
advocacy, electoral activities, and institutional reforms. As a result, the classification of political texts is
prone to the problem of concept drift where the underlying properties of the target concept change over
time. Using machine learning, we modify the existing approach to text classification to accommodate
change in issue ownership and issue frame.
Applying machine learning for concept drift analysis, we develop a computational approach to detect
and track temporal changes of (1) issue ownership and (2) issue frames. In the former application,
we identify the critical words that come to characterize the policy focus of each political group at different
time steps. In the latter application, we focus on the rate and pattern of frame turnover in the
parliamentary discourse on controversial policy issues. We compiled and applied a diachronic corpus
from the published chamber remarks of the National Assembly of France in the period 2003 to 2010
and (to be specified), respectively. Our results indicate that term preferences change temporally and
the asymmetry is potentially meaningful in terms of policy deliberations. They also support our future
efforts to account for concept drift in analyzing long-running political deliberations.

<h2>Scam detection </h2>
It is not easy for human users to recognize the scam from trustworthy advertisement. In this project we analyze different statistics to characterize the scam from
trustworthy advertisement.  We apply machine learning techniques and build the classifier to perform scam detection.

<h2>Design protocol for adaptive security and privacy mechanisms in large-scale information systems</h2>
In this work, we propose an adaptive design method based on nine principles and use social networking as an example application. These nine principles informed the
initial design and re.nement throughout time of such a project. We aim to draw attention to different potential security and privacy challenges inherent in the design
of a large-scale adaptive system. One possible reason for the ongoing presence of emergent security/privacy problems in large-scale applications is the fact that they
were initiated without a framework adequate for conceptualization, selection, review and update of security and privacy design decisions. The proposed principles are
grounded in design theory, in.uenced by complex systems and illustrated in the following case studies.

<h2><a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S8/S12">Bio-creative III</a></h2>
Bio-creative challenge is a text mining competition that focuses on biological information extraction. Our works was about applying the computational techniques to
identify the biological entities such as protein, enzyme names and protein-protein interactions from the biological documents. I was working in an article
classification task (ACT). I develop software to extract textual features and visualize them according to their rank in each class.  I also develop software to perform
VTT classification. <br>
Before extracting the features, I did several preprocessing on the data such as removing the stop words, removing the non-textual characters, and stemming with porter
stemming algorithm. Textual features were unigrams (single words), bigrams, and short-window pairs (SP). Short window pairs are type of bigram that are selected over
top unigram instead of the all unigram. I looked at different measure to find better discriminatory features. Extracted features can be ranked with the following
scores:<br>
TF, average TF over positive documents, IDF, IDF for positive documents, IDF for negative documents, TF-IDF, S1 measure, S2 measure, rank product of different
combination of the mentioned score, such as rank product of TF-IDF and S1, and rank product of S2.
